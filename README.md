# dungeonjumper
**dungeonjumper.github.io** is a quick, one page website showcasing my recent works and exploration with various technologies. It was built in [Middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman) and uses [Bourbon Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat) to set up a responsive grid. This repo also includes some miscellaneous project folders such as this [Soapmaking Workshop](http://dungeonjumper.github.io/cp-soap) that I occasionally run.
