		<p>I have a name and background that is just as unique as my DNA.</p>

		<p>I started my career with some college coursework at the University of Vermont, where I also worked in a genetics lab to isolate neurons to support research on sensory receptors. Upon transferring to the University of Akron where I received my degree in Biochemistry, I conducted independent research projects in metalloproteomics and protein structure. After graduation, I taught myself how to code which led me to my current position as a developer for I-SITE in Philadelphia, PA.</p>

		<p>When I'm not busy working, I enjoy teaching and TAing local classes that range from the chemistry of soapmaking at the Department of Making and Doing, to web design and development at Girl Develop It. I write, produce, and distribute zines at Fluxxii Distro, which is a small project that I started in 2010 to promote independent voices on mental health. I am also part of a great team of folks who help organize the annual Philadelphia Feminist Zine Fest. And above all, I am an avid runner who - like most runners - simply can't/won't shut up about running. Also, because I feel like it needs to be said: I will defend the oxford comma to my death.</p>

		<p>I love connecting and geeking out about things, both new and old. Feel free to get in touch.</p>
